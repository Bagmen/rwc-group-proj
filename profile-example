<p> I am a fifteen year old soon-to-be Sophomore as of 2018 and I am
looking forward to studying Computer Science in the future. I have an interest in the 
Software Development field and would like to help develop new and innovative
applications and other products. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar and videogames.
